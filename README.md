# PSO_Neighborhoods
Nature-Inspired Computation Project 2 

In order to run the program first compile with:
javac PSO.java

An example of running the program is as follows:
java PSO gl 30 10000 ack 30

Parameters are in the order of:
Which neighborhood topology to test(gl, ri, vn, ra)
the size of the swarm
the number of iterations
the function to optimize 
the dimensionality of the function

All .java files are classes used except for Sandbox (used for testing code). You may also ignore the copy of PSO
Neighborhoods.
